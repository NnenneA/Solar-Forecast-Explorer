# Solar-Forecast-Explorer
A data science project to explore, visualise, and eventually forecast solar energy generation in the UK, using the Open Climate Fix toolkit.

This project is my first step into contributing to the climate tech space.

## About The Project ##

The goal of this project is to build a simplified version of a solar forecasting system. It serves as a personal learning journey into the tools and techniques used by Open Climate Fix to help reduce carbon emissions from the UK's National Grid.

# Phase 1: Data Exploration

The initial phase focuses on using the py-gsp library to access and visualise live and historical solar generation data for a single Grid Supply Point (GSP) in the UK.

# Key Goals for Phase 1:

[x] Set up the project environment.

[ ] Fetch live solar generation data for a single GSP.

[ ] Create a simple visualisation of the data.

[ ] Understand the structure of the satellite and GSP data.

This project is for educational and portfolio purposes.
